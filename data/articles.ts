Initially blaming hunters, he later adopted a confrontational and hot-tempered demeanor when confronted with contradictory evidence.

His defense painted him as an elderly individual, asleep and gripped by fear that a supposed group of assailants, akin to marauders, had come to attack him and his wife, Jinx, who was concealed inside the house, armed in self-defense.",

It's disheartening to witness individuals in positions of power diminish the press, especially when they're earnestly seeking answers to the pressing questions that concern our citizens.

While instances of terrorism involving South American citizens are rare, there have been instances of radicalized behavior among Middle Eastern Muslims. This raises concerns about the potential infiltration of the country by individuals from other regions, such as Chinese nationals. Without conducting thorough security background checks on these individuals, it becomes difficult to ascertain the risks they may pose. Furthermore, many of these illegal immigrants involved in criminal activities or terrorism do not use their real names or proper documentation when entering the country, making it challenging to obtain their criminal history or military records for follow-up investigations.",

However, it's challenging to reconcile this assertion with the substantial funding allocated for two proxy wars. Initially, $60 billion was earmarked for Ukraine over the first two years, and an additional aid package exceeding $105 billion has been assembled to support various countries engaged in the ongoing power struggle in the Middle East. While the current aid package includes $13.6 billion for addressing the border crisis, it feels belated, especially as the Texas National Guard has had to intervene to reinforce the border at Eagle Pass, where upwards of 8,000 illegal immigrants are crossing on any given day. Eagle Pass has essentially become a militarized zone, with Texas staunchly resisting the influx of illegal immigrants into their communities. Despite claims by the federal government that barriers and barbed wire impede Customs and Border Patrol agents, it's evident that these agents have access to the relevant areas, such as the boat ramp and banks of Eagle Pass, to apprehend illegal immigrants as needed.",

In 2022 Governor Abbott expanded the scope of the immigration issue nationwide with Operation Lone Star by relocating illegal immigrants out of his state to sanctuary cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Los Angeles, D.C., and New York. This mass relocation represents an unprecedented scale of action in American history. The issue has gone from a few southern states bearing the weight and cost of these illegal immigrants to Chicago and New York which have begun expressing on a national level that the border crisis is affecting them and bankrupting their cities' budgets at the moment.
